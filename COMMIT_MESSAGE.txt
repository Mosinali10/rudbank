- Added DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md with complete deployment steps
- Added test-api.js for automated API testing
- Added .env.example with configuration template
- Added FIXES_APPLIED.md with detailed fix documentation
- Updated README.md with troubleshooting section

🎯 Impact:
- Login now works correctly (200 status)
- Dashboard loads after authentication
- Profile endpoint returns user data
- Cookies are properly set and sent
- Better error visibility in production logs
